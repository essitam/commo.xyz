    Submissions are currently CLOSED. When we reopen for submissions, please follow these guidelines. / Submissions are currently OPEN. Please follow these guidelines and have your submission in by the deadline of APRIL 25, 2021.
    <br><br>
    Submit: Submit up to ten (10) pages of writing, whatever form it takes. Include a short bio and anything else you would like us to know about your work. If there is any accompanying media you would like to include with your submission, pass it along. Please send your submission as an attachment, preferably word doc (.doc) although PDFs are fine for unconventionally formatted works. If submitting multiple pieces of writing, include them in a single document with each piece beginning on a new page. The subject line of your email should be SUBMISSION.
    <br><br>
    We encourage everyone to submit, regardless of publication history.
    <br><br>
    All published work remains the intellectual property of the artist. We prefer work that is previously unpublished. Simultaneous submissions are fine, but let us know if your work has been accepted elsewhere.
    <br><br>
    Writers living on the margins take priority. Submissions are free and we pay contributors $75 CAD upon publication. This amount remains the same in the case of collaborative pieces.
    <br><br>
    Expect to hear back from us within two months of closing submissions. If after that point you haven't heard from us, please send a follow-up inquiry.
